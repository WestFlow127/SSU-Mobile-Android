Pre-show discussion from 6-7pm.<br /><br />One of the greatest plays of the 20th century, this darkly funny masterpiece gets a massive remix in a dance/theater mash-up, exploring text and character through acting, dance, original music, technology and design. &quot;The play tells the story of an aristocratic Russian woman and her family as they return to their family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. While presented with options to save the estate, the family essentially does nothing and the play ends with the sale f the estate to the son of a former serf. The family leaves to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down. This Chekhov classic presents themes of cultural futility &#8211; both the futile attempts of the aristocracy to maintain its status and of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its newfound materialism. In reflecting the socio-economic forces at work in Russia at the turn of the 20th century, including the rise of the middle class after the abolition of serfdom and the sinking of the aristocracy, the play reflects forces at work around the globe in that period.&quot;        -- Wikipedia ", "Title": "Orchard Development", "Deleted": "2015-08-30 13:47:25", "Created": "2015-03-16 00:00:03", "Location": "Evert B.
